# Off Board Blink
For the Offboard_Blink circuitry I used the Same Circuit that was used for the multiple blink part of the lab.

# To build the circuitry the parts that I used are as follows:

1- MSP430G2553 (Microprocessor)
	I used the Dev-Kit as a means of power supply and reset
	I attempted to power the board with (3) Batteries connected in series(didn't work)

1- Breadboard (Pin-Type)

2- Green LEDS (2.2 Volts)

2- 330 ohm resistors for the LED's

# Description
The video of the OffBoard Solution can be found within this Repository but I was unable to attach it within the README

The pins that I connected to were the ground pins, the 3.3 Volt supply, Test, Reset and the output pins for both of the LED's

The operation of the Controller functions just as expected. It is a very interesting concept to be able to program the chip and implement it in a different environment. This particular IC would be very useful for creating a project that needed to be sized down and powered by batteries such as an electronic game or other small consumer electronic.

In the future I feel that there is a lot that can be applied to the removal chip concept for this board. I did not have the time to experiment with this portion of the lab as much as I would have liked to. However, it opened my eyes to some of the applications that this can be used for.
